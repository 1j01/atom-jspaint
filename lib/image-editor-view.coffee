			# Then we get the data URI from the canvas so we can
			# Send it to the page(!), which
			# Loads the URI as an image, and finally
			# Puts it on the canvas
			# SOUNDS LEGIT LET'S SHIP IT

			# maybe if it was an Image? I doubt that would make a difference
			# no wait, create the image from within the page's document; that might work
